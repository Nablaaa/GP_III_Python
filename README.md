**Gaussian Uncertainity Propagation**

This Repository contains an implementation for gaussian uncertainity propagation for experiments in the course "GP III" for the bachelor in physics at the TU Dresden.

The programme "Gauss.py" is the main programme which can be modified for other experiments.
After this term you′ll find several formulas needed for experiments for modern physics e.g. millikan′s oil drop experiment, radiometry or holography.

**How to use this repository**

- you are the first one working on a new experiment: create a folder with abbreviation of your experiment
- if there is already a folder with your experiment but there is missing one variable for which you would like to compute the uncertainity: copy Gauss.py and save as (abbreviation of your experiment)_(variable).py in this folder
